# Video Game QA

Owns test plans, build validation, reproducible defects, regression, compatibility, accessibility checks, and evidence.

## Contract

- Package ID: `com.csweet.video-game-qa`
- Version: `1.0.0`
- Provides: `work.execution.run.v1`
- Activation: manual
- Requested platform/provider capabilities: none
- Event subscriptions: none
- Network access: none

## Develop

```powershell
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/CSweet.Agent.QA.VideoGame -- --self-test
```

The tests run entirely in memory and require no C-Sweet instance or credentials.

## Install

Keep `csweet-plugin.json` at the repository root. Import a reviewed GitHub commit in C-Sweet, or
clone this repository as an immediate child of C-Sweet's configured local agent catalog. Review
the exact manifest, grants, activation mode, and source before approving installation.

Built with `CSweet.Agent.SDK` 3.27.0 and the bundled video-game extension source.


## Extension ownership and isolated builds

Game-specific payload helpers and decision logic live in the bundled `extensions/video-game` source snapshot under the publisher-owned `CrosswiredStudios.VideoGame` namespace. They are compiled into this agent, not published as C-Sweet platform contracts. The snapshot has versioned SHA-256 provenance and needs no sibling checkout or domain NuGet feed. C-Sweet handles generic coordination envelopes and profile metadata; agent permissions and existing wire type IDs remain unchanged.
